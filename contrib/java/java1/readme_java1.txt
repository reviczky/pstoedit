The files PsPages.java and PsDrawing.java contain the JAVA source
code of the classes needed to run the code generated by the -f java
option of pstoedit.

To use the output, do:
javac PsPages.java
javac PsDrawing.java

pstoedit -f java:myclass myfile.ps myclass.java
javac myclass.java

Then create an HTML document like:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE> PsDrawing generated by pstoedit </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This is the applet:<P>
<APPLET code="PsDrawing.class" width=700 height=800>
	<PARAM name="psjavaclass" value="myclass">
</APPLET>
</BODY>
</HTML>

And launch a java enabled web browser.

This Java 1 based version provides limited features due
to the many restrictions of Java 1. In the java2 directory
there is a newer version based on Java 2 which provides
much better output than the Java 1 based version.


Finally, the source code is covered by the GPL the same way as pstoedit.
This does not include the code generated by pstoedit! 
See the file Copying in the main directory of the pstoedit distribution
for the details of the GPL.
