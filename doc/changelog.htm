<h1 align="left">Changelog for pstoedit</h1>

<h2>New or changed in 3.62:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>new backend generating PowerPoint pptx files contributed by Scott Pakin. Big thanks!!! This backend uses the zip library http://www.nih.at/libzip/ .</li>
  <li>improved handling of composite fonts, especially those having FMapType other than 2</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in detecting rectangles.</li>
  <li>improved bounding box tracing in case of text (but it is still not perfect).</li>
  <li>changed the creation of filenames when using the -split option. Related to that there is
    new option -pagenumberformat. See manual for more details.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in passing generic libplot arguments to the libplot drivers.</li>
  <li>improved support for 64-bit systems related the integration of pstoedit to gsview.</li>
  <li>include a version info resource in pstoedit's windows exe and DLLs. </li>
  <li>include a work-around for a Hurd specific problem with dlclose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.61:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug in handling of -page option</li>
  <li>improved support for 64-bit systems related to different version of ghostscript</li>
  <li>added some features for supporting the LaOS project (<a href="http://www.laoslaser.org/">http://www.laoslaser.org/</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.60:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added option (-minlinewidth) for adjusting very thin (e.g. zero-width) lines to a
    minimal width.</li>
  <li>added an option (-pslanguagelevel) for easy switching the language level to be used by
    GhostScript during interpretation of the PostScript/PDF file.</li>
  <li>new driver for the &quot;Context Free&quot; drawing tool (<a
    href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">http://www.contextfreeart.org/</a> ) contributed by
    Scott Pakin.</li>
  <li>fixed the windows binary version - some drivers were missing.</li>
  <li>fixed some problems in handling composite fonts (FontType = 0)</li>
  <li>windows 32 bit binary can call 64 bit ghostscript as exe (i.e. not via DLL interface)</li>
  <li>support for 64 bit windows and Office 2010</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.50:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added an option (-gs) to specify the full path to GhostScript (under Windows - either
    the .exe or the DLL). This can be used by portable applications to direct pstoedit to use
    a specific GhostScript version.</li>
  <li>Stanislav Brabec contributed several improvements to the PCB driver. See <a
    href="http://www.penguin.cz/~utx/pstoedit-pcb/">http://www.penguin.cz/~utx/pstoedit-pcb/</a>
    on how these can be useful.</li>
  <li>Scott Pakin submitted several improvements to the mpost driver and the font substitution
    mechanism.</li>
  <li>new driver for .vtk files e.g. for ParaView - <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">http://www.paraview.org/</a>
    - but this is still a very basic version. Thanks to Mitesh Patel for initiating and
    testing.</li>
  <li>new driver for cairo (<a href="http://cairographics.org/">http://cairographics.org/</a>
    ) contributed by Dan McMahill. This driver generates C-code which can be compiled and
    linked against the cairo libraries. See the contrib/cairo directory for an example.</li>
  <li>several improvements on the DXF driver as suggested and sponsored by Markus Meyer.</li>
  <li>because pstoedit may write its output to stdout, all output written by GhostScript to
    stdout is now redirected to stderr in order to avoid mixed output.</li>
  <li>added a -q option to suppress the initial startup message of pstoedit. This can by
    useful when being called via a pipe, e.g. from inkscape. However, note that this does not
    suppress all output written to stderr - see also note above.</li>
  <li>John Bowman fixed a number of problems related to clipping and image support for the
    Asymptote backend.</li>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem with g++ V4.x.</li>
  <li>new driver for gcode (.ngc files) (tested with emc see <a href="http://linuxcnc.org">http://linuxcnc.org</a>).
    Contributed by Lawrence Glaister.</li>
  <li>some adaptations for newer versions of libming</li>
  <li>fixed a line width problem for xfig format.</li>
  <li>corrected the broken pstoedit.m4 - thanks to Ian Abbott</li>
  <li>some minor code beautifying.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.45:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Some minor corrections of warnings issued by Coverity Prevent (security related checks).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the fig backend related to dotted lines.</li>
  <li>added better support for pagesize handling in the driver framework.</li>
  <li>better handling of fonts using 0 encoded characters (thanks to Vladimir Eltsov).</li>
  <li>fixed a problem which caused newer versions of GhostScript to go into an endless loop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.44:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>hotfix for the Aysmptote driver to make it compatible with Aysmptote version 1.00.</li>
  <li>removed some diagnostic messages concerning temporary file handling.</li>
  <li>removed the pstoedit-config.* since this is replaced by the pkg-config file pstoedit.pc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.43:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>some usability improvements as proposed in Debian Bug Report #347732 <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/msg/c38e1f79d75b3152?dmode=source&amp;hl=de">http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/msg/c38e1f79d75b3152?dmode=source&amp;hl=de</a></li>
  <li>cleaned some minor problems found by the Klocwork checker (<a
    href="http://www.klocwork.com">www.klocwork.com</a> )</li>
  <li>replaced tempnam with mkstemp where available.</li>
  <li>replaced several string related functions with the secure versions where available
    (Windows - VC++2005)</li>
  <li>switched back again to calling GhostScript as .exe instead of via the DLL in case
    pstoedit is called via gsview. Reason - there can be only one instance of GhostScript per
    process and gsview needs a second instance.</li>
  <li>a new driver for the OpenOffice metafile format (drvsvm) contributed by Thorsten
    Behrens.</li>
  <li>source code cleanup considering messages issued by Gimpel's FlexeLint/PC-Lint (<a
    href="http://www.gimpel.com">www.gimpel.com</a> ).</li>
  <li>added a &quot;-glyphs&quot; option. Given this option, the PostScript frontend passes
    also (if possible) the glyph names to the backend. However, so far no backend really uses
    the glyph names. This is only a preparation for future work.</li>
  <li>changed the way how Image/Graphicmagick is handled by configure. Now configure tries to
    use pkg-config as proposed by the maintainer of the Debian version of pstoedit (Ray
    Dassen).</li>
  <li>included a further patch for the Aysmptote driver.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.42:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the Aysmptote driver now supports PNG images - thanks again to John Bowman</li>
  <li>fix of small compilation problem in drvlatex2e.cpp</li>
  <li>new driver (drvnoi) contributed by Nemetschek (<a href="http://www.nemetschek.de/">http://www.nemetschek.de/</a>).
    This driver - in combination with other DLLs which are installed as part of Nemetschek's
    AllPlan product - allows to convert PostScript and PDF to the AllPlan internal format.
    Without an installation of AllPlan - this driver is &quot;useless&quot;. Nemetschek also
    contributed some code for circle detection but this is not yet included in pstoedit. It
    will be included in future and will then allow to generate circle primitives for formats
    which support such elements. (Currently circles are represented as Bezier curves)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.41:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added a .asy backend for Asymptote files ( <a href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/">http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/</a>
    ). Thanks to John Bowman</li>
  <li>fixed three bugs (one memory leak, two other minor problems) detected by the Coverity
    Prevent tool (<a href="http://www.coverity.com/">http://www.coverity.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>PostScript frontend: fixed a bug in tracing the bounding box of raster images.</li>
  <li>updated gsdll.h to newer version in order to avoid misunderstandings with respect to
    license.</li>
  <li>new option &quot;-useoldpolydraw&quot; for advanced (w)emf driver - avoid usage of the
    Windows function PolyDraw which sometimes creates EMF files which cannot be loaded (but in
    most cases creates better EMF files than the old mode).</li>
  <li>improved resolution in the standard and free EMF driver. Note: the WMF format is no
    longer supported under non-Window systems since libemf has some fundamental problems.</li>
  <li>the PostScript/PDF Office import DLL (importps) can now be used also within Visio (TM).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in sub path handling - thanks to Soren Henriksen.</li>
  <li>fixed the handling of some special characters in the LaTeX2e format driver.</li>
  <li>installed a sourceforge project at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pstoedit">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pstoedit</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.40:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added more diagnosis to dynload.cpp concerning dynamic loading.</li>
  <li>added an option -filledrecttostroke for converting filled rectangles to simple line
    strokes.</li>
  <li>support for cygwin environment.</li>
  <li>portability fixed concerning AIX, SGI, and Mac-OS. Many thanks especially to Maarten
    Sneep for his patience and support related to the Mac-OS port. Getting the dynamic loading
    of the plugins working was quite tricky.</li>
  <li>new versions of libtool, automake, and autoconf.</li>
  <li>new prologue for generated idraw files.</li>
  <li>the fig driver now supports &quot;line cap styles&quot; and &quot;line join styles&quot;</li>
  <li>some patches the the Mathematica backend by Manfred Thole.</li>
  <li>added -dNOEPS as option when calling GhostScript because pstoedit is tuned to the old
    (pre-8.0) behavior of GhostScript.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in drvwmf.cpp concerning the handling of font names.</li>
  <li>disabled the WMF driver when libemf is used (all non-Windows systems). Libemf does not
    really handle WMF files. A CreateMetaFile effectively creates an EnhMetaFile - but that
    confuses programs which expect an real WMF file in a file with a .wmf suffix.</li>
  <li>added a workaround in the EMF driver for a bug/problem in the libemf which is used under
    *nix for EMF generation. The problem in libemf is that if text is rendered using the
    simple TextOut function call the resulting EMF file is no longer usable under newer
    versions of Windows. For more details see the description of the -nfw option of the wmf
    format driver.</li>
  <li>added an option &quot;-usebbfrominput&quot;. If specified, pstoedit uses the BoundingBox
    as is (hopefully) found in the input file instead of one that is calculated by its own.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug concerning handling of leading white space in SVG text elements.</li>
  <li>add new driver to &quot;insulate/PCB&quot; format (see <a
    href="http://home.vr-web.de/~hans-juergen-jahn/software/devpcb.html">http://home.vr-web.de/~hans-juergen-jahn/software/devpcb.html</a>
    ) contributed by Hans-Jürgen Jahn for more details.</li>
  <li>add new set of drivers for gschem ( <a
    href="http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:gschem_ug">http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:gschem_ug</a>
    ) and PCB (<a href="http://pcb.sourceforge.net">http://pcb.sourceforge.net</a> )
    contributed by Mark Rages.<br>
    (see also <a href="http://mlug.missouri.edu/~markrages/software/pstoedit_additions/">http://mlug.missouri.edu/~markrages/software/pstoedit_additions/</a>
    )</li>
  <li>Updated code for finding newest version of ghostscript - thanks to Russell Lang.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the MIF backend concerning handling of PNG images (sometimes wrong
    rotation).</li>
  <li>the installation setup.exe for pstoedit now writes into the registry so gsview can find
    pstoedit at any place and hence it is no longer needed to install pstoedit within a
    subdirectory of gsview.</li>
  <li>the HPGL driver now also supports writing of text as text. So far, text was drawn as
    lines. Thanks to Peter Kuhlemann.</li>
  <li>option to allow merging of adjacent text fragments into one single text object (general
    option -mergetext).</li>
  <li>the DXF driver now allows to map objects to different layers based on their color
    (driver option -ctl). Default is to allocated all objects on layer 0.</li>
  <li>try to deduce driver name from the suffix of the output file if the driver name is not
    explicitly given via -f</li>
  <li>added option &quot;-ups&quot; for using plain strings instead of hex strings in
    intermediate format (for debug purposes only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.33:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>removed duplicate entries in list of available formats.</li>
  <li>improved configure and even better support for autotrace (thanks to Masatake for the
    patches).</li>
  <li>removed some internal trace messages written to cout for debug purposes.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in CGM driver (wrong bounding box).</li>
  <li>more robust parsing of fontmap files.</li>
  <li>support of fonts that use \n and \r as character codes.</li>
  <li>added an option (-ndt) to fully disable the heuristics used by pstoedit to decide when
    to &quot;draw&quot; text instead of showing it as text. This may produce incorrect
    results, but in some cases it might nevertheless be useful. &quot;Use at own risk&quot;.</li>
  <li>added a -correctdefinefont option for working around a problem related to ChemDraw
    generated PostScript files.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug concerning loading of shared libraries under HP-UX. Thanks to Antonio
    Carrarini for the support in tracking down the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.32:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>some smaller bug and portability fixes.</li>
  <li>workaround to cope with a change introduced since ghostscript 7.04. Some new operators
    were added to ghostscript's internal array of operators without increasing the maximum
    size of the array. This led to the problem, that pstoedit couldn't add further operators.</li>
  <li>EMF backend now fully supported also under Linux and *nix like systems. Thanks to Allen
    Barnett <a href="mailto:(allen_AT_lignumcomputing.com">(allen_AT_lignumcomputing.com</a>)
    for getting libemf to work in combination with pstoedit.</li>
  <li>new backend using the ImageMagick++ API. Thanks to Bob Friesenhahn <a
    href="mailto:(bfriesen_AT_simple.dallas.tx.us">(bfriesen_AT_simple.dallas.tx.us</a>) for
    his patience and support. This works only with versions 5.4.8 and later of ImageMagick.</li>
  <li>under Windows, now the registry is searched for the latest version of GhostScript if no
    GhostScript configuration setting was found from gsview. Thanks to Russell Lang for some
    example code concerning the registry lookup.</li>
  <li>new code for translating PNG images to PostScript by Niklas Peinecke - <a
    href="mailto:peinecke_AT_informatik.uni-hannover.de">peinecke_AT_informatik.uni-hannover.de</a>.
    (needs libgd (<a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd"><font color="#0000FF"><u>http://www.boutell.com/gd</u></font></a>)
    to compile.) - not fully integrated yet.</li>
  <li>internal redesign of option handling to keep the documentation and code closer together.</li>
  <li>make pstoedit.h usable from plain C programs such as autotrace.</li>
  <li>added a -use_correct_font_size option to the xfig driver to support the same option of
    xfig.</li>
  <li>improved configure and Makefile.in - Thanks to Masatake Yamoto - <a
    href="mailto:jet_AT_gyve.org">jet_AT_gyve.org</a></li>
  <li>pstoedit can now be used as sort of plugin to autotrace to make all formats supported by
    pstoedit available to autotrace - also this was done primarily by Masatake Yamoto.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.31:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>prepared the EMF/WMF drivers to compile against the libEMF (<a
    href="mailto:libemf_AT_lignumcomputing.com">libemf_AT_lignumcomputing.com</a>) which
    allows to create EMF files under *nix. But - the libEMF is not yet released. Stay tuned.</li>
  <li>include some patches for the OS/2 port and bug fixes for drvmma and drvmet submitted by
    Thomas Hoffmann (<a href="mailto:thoffman_AT_zappa.sax.de">thoffman_AT_zappa.sax.de</a>).</li>
  <li>automatic conversion of curves to lines also in case the -bo (backend only) option is
    used and the target format/driver doesn't support curves.</li>
  <li>Donald Arseneau (asnd_AT_triumf.ca) adds pen changes when color changes to the HPGL
    backend. To be activated using the -pencolors option.</li>
  <li>several portability fixed, e.g. now pstoedit compiles with g++3.0.</li>
  <li>changed the place where pstoedit's data file (font map tables, ...) are stored
    ($prefix/share/pstoedit under *nix).</li>
  <li>added support to produce the shared library libpstoedit.so under Linux - Thanks to
    Russell Lang.</li>
  <li>added a general -help option for each driver to show driver specific options. For
    example -f xfig:-help shows specific options for the fig backend.</li>
  <li>minor bug fix in CGM backend - some pathes triggered an assertion violation.</li>
  <li>several enhancements for the DXF backend. Now it supports the DXF SPLINE element as
    well. Big thanks to Daniel Gehriger <a href="mailto:gehriger_AT_linkcad.com">(gehriger_AT_linkcad.com</a>)
    for his help concerning the DXF format.</li>
  <li>support for TeX fonts in the SVG backend. Big thanks to Michel Goossens for the
    suggestions and his help. He can also provide the SVG definitions of the CM TeX fonts. See
    also <a href="http://home.cern.ch/goossens/svgfonts.html">http://home.cern.ch/goossens/svgfonts.html</a>
    .</li>
  <li>Now the SVG driver also supports a font map.</li>
  <li>some minor bug fixes in the PostScript frontend related to font handling.</li>
  <li>changed &quot;Killustrator&quot; to &quot;Kontour&quot; where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.30:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>new backend for Mathematica - contributed by Manfred Thole &lt;manfred_AT_thole.org&gt;</li>
  <li>new SWF backend (beta release state - still lot's of features missing (fonts, dash
    handling, ...). This backend is based on the ming API (<a
    href="http://www.opaque.net/ming/">www.opaque.net/ming/</a>).</li>
  <li>cleanup of the xfig backend. In some cases X-splines looked very different from the
    original image. Now the X-splines that are produced by the xfig backend are constrained
    differently, so that they fit the bezier curve better. Thanks to Ian MacPhedran.</li>
  <li>added an option -startdepth to the xfig driver</li>
  <li>improved support for various types of PostScript image operators. Now there is an option
    for backend developers to ask for a PNG file to be generated directly by the frontend (at
    GhostScript level). Currently this is used only for the SVG backend, but more will follow
    later.</li>
  <li>added an option -adt (automatic draw text). This selectively enables -dt for all fonts
    that don't look like a text font.</li>
  <li>Now the BoundingBox is provided to the backends - though not all make use of it so far.</li>
  <li>man improvements to the SVG backend (plugin) like support for dashes, clipping, raster
    images, Symbol font</li>
  <li>fixed a bug which showed up with PostScript files generated by the new Adobe PostScript
    driver.</li>
  <li>some extensions (new options) to the TK backend - contributed by Chris Cox</li>
  <li>added support for writing the output to a file it the input is stdin (pstoedit -f format
    - outfile). This allows to implement a pstoedit printer driver via redmon. You can print
    directly to any format pstoedit supports directly from any Windows application.</li>
  <li>-rgb (instead of now default CMYK)</li>
  <li>now pages can be rotated arbitrarily (-rotate). Thanks to Andrew Birrell
    &lt;birrell_AT_pa.dec.com&gt; for the permission to use the corresponding code from
    pstotext).</li>
  <li>made the source code almost clean concerning FlexeLint messages (By the way, I like this
    tool- see <a href="http://www.gimpel.com">www.gimpel.com</a> )</li>
  <li>addes some assertions in to the code to further runtime checking</li>
  <li>added a %TGIF header to support the Unix file command. (Thanks to <a
    href="mailto:Gintautas.Grigelionis_AT_ki.ericsson.se">Gintautas.Grigelionis_AT_ki.ericsson.se</a>)</li>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem with SUN's C++ compilers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.21:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>some extensions (new options) to the TK backend. Now supports multiple pages as well -
    Thanks to Chris Cox. See manual for more details.</li>
  <li>bugfix : -pagesize option was not recognized correctly.</li>
  <li>minor bugfix in FIG backend to be compliant with prtfig.</li>
  <li>bugfix in the frontend (lexer). Now the lexer can be started multiple times after each
    other. This is important for programs using the pstoedit.dll.</li>
  <li>added support for writing PNG in image.cpp. Now backends can use this to write raster
    images into PNG files.</li>
  <li>improved plugins: CGM (supports Bezier now), SVG (supports raster images) and EMF
    (supports raster images), importps (supports raster images).</li>
  <li>reanimation of the OS/2 port - thanks to Thomas Hoffmann.</li>
  <li>the binary releases are now linked with the libplotter (GNU plotutils <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html</a>
    ) to allow direct access to the variety of drivers contained in that library (FIG, PCL,
    HPGL, TEK, X11 (Unix only), SVG, CGM, AI). Some formats are now available in two versions.
    One directly with a native driver in pstoedit and one via the libplot.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now cooperates with autotrace. Autotrace can now produce a dump file for
    further processing by pstoedit using the -bo (backend only) option. Autotrace is a program
    written by a group around Martin Weber and can be found at <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.20:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug with precision text (-pti/a).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in pstoedit.ph.</li>
  <li>new backend latex2e contributed by <a href="mailto:scott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org">Scott Pakin</a>.</li>
  <li>include SVG driver into binary releases for Linux/Solaris.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.19:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>experimental support for filling in the HPGL backend.</li>
  <li>implement copypage same as showpage plus emit a warning.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in consistency checking (frontend vs. backend when using the -bo option)</li>
  <li>automatic enabling of -dt option if backend doesn't support text.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in memory allocation. Windows requires that the memory is deallocated in the
    same DLL as it was allocated. This was a problem with some plugins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.18:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>new java2 backend which supports much better rendering than the old java1 backend.
    Thanks to <a href="mailto:gisbert_AT_tapirsoft.de">Gisbert W. Selke</a> of <a
    href="http://www.tapirsoft.de">TapirSoft Gisbert &amp; Harald Selke GbR</a>.</li>
  <li>new option (-t2fontast1) to handle type 2 fonts similarly to t1 fonts - This is sort of
    experimental.</li>
  <li>fixed one bug in the binary cgm (too long header).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the configure script.</li>
  <li>made the postscript output again more DSC compliant as pointed out by Russell Lang</li>
  <li>made the code more &quot;cleaner&quot; concerning rules checked by CodeWizard (<a
    href="http://www.parasoft.com">www.parasoft.com</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.17:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>included a patch for idraw to support bitmap images. Thanks to Scott Johnston for the
    contribution.</li>
  <li>much improved WMF backend by Thorsten Behrens.</li>
  <li>experimental support for SVG (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG</a>/)
    in the <a href="http://www.pstoedit.net/plugins/">plugins.dll</a>.</li>
  <li>added a function to the DLL interface for gsview to clean up memory allocated by the
    pstoedit.dll.</li>
  <li>added an option (-uchar) which allows to define the character to be used instead of
    characters that are not available in the standard character encoding but nevertheless used
    by the input PostScript/PDF file.</li>
  <li>allow standard output to be used also for backends that don't support multiple pages as
    suggested by Andread Amann</li>
  <li>added a BeginSetup / EndSetup to the PostScript output to allow reading in CorelDraw 3/4
    as proposed by Martin Weber</li>
  <li>added a consistency check if the -bo option is used to avoid problems when the selected
    backend has some restrictions, e.g. does not support curves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.16:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>fixed some small memory leaks (missing [] with delete) and a potential null pointer
    access. Thanks to <a href="http://www.parasoft.com">Parasoft</a> for a temporary license
    for Linux of their Insure++. It was quite easy to find these bugs with this tool.</li>
  <li>changed the starting depth of objects in xfig format from 999 to 499. This allows new
    objects to be inserted in front or behind the converted figure.</li>
  <li>the makefile for pstoedit can now be configured automatically using configure - at least
    on Un*x like systems. Thanks <a href="mailto:scott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org">Scott Pakin</a> for
    providing the necessary packages.</li>
  <li>added the -pti and -pta option which allows for &quot;precision text&quot; via
    individual placement of each character within a string.</li>
  <li>the tgif backend now supports arbitray streched text. The text placement is currently
    not fully correct. This problem will probably be fixed in tgif 4.1.26.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.15:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem and makefile problem (make install).</li>
  <li>switch to a new documentation style. The manual page is now originally written in LaTeX
    and translated to Un*x man format and HTML. Thanks to Rolf Niepraschk (<a
    href="mailto:niepraschk_AT_ptb.de">niepraschk_AT_ptb.de</a>) for this work. The Linux
    community will have big thanks for this contribution.</li>
  <li>added a new option to set the page size for the output medium. However this is currently
    used by the libplot backend only.</li>
  <li>some small correction on the libplot driver.</li>
  <li>fixed the broken -scale option for the tgif backend.</li>
  <li>backends can now access the current setting of the miterlimit using currentMiterLimit().</li>
  <li>text consisting entirely of spaces is now suppressed. This caused problems with some
    backends, e.g. xfig.</li>
  <li>changed the version of drvbase (because of the miterlimit and pagesize support). This
    means that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will
    get an error message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.14:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added two checkboxes for the importps dialog</li>
  <li>bug fix related to font caching in the EMF backend</li>
  <li>added a bugfix for the MetaPost backend received from Scott Pakin</li>
  <li>incorporated a lot of improvements to the libplot driver. Thanks to Robert S. Maier (<a
    href="mailto:rsm_AT_math.arizona.edu">rsm_AT_math.arizona.edu</a>)<br>
    Notice: most of these improvement will need at least libplot version 2.3. See drvlplot.cpp
    for all the new options.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now implicitly looks for a driver specific fontmap file named
    &lt;drivername&gt;.fmp</li>
  <li>fixed a problem (bug in gs?) which was caused by some PDF files when gs5.50 was used.
    This problem did not occur anymore with newer versions of gs.</li>
  <li>added the classed needed by the generated Java Code to the distribution (see java
    subdirectory)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.13:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>change in frontend and drvbase: Now the full effective font matrix can be retrieved by
    backends</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase (because of the font matrix functions). This means
    that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get
    an error message.</li>
  <li>added a new backend for the skencil (formerly sketch) format (<a
    href="http://www.skencil.org/">www.skencil.org</a>) contributed by<br>
    Bernhard Herzog (<a href="mailto:bernhard_AT_users.sourceforge.net">bernhard_AT_users.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>
  <li>many improvements in the MetaPost backend and a better fontmap.mpost by Scott Pakin.</li>
  <li>minor bug fix with line width and text elements in the TGIF backend.</li>
  <li>added an option to the TGIF backend to generate HREF attributes for each text element
    (proposed by Tobias Buchal <a href="mailto:buchal41_AT_che41a0.der.edf.fr">buchal41_AT_che41a0.der.edf.fr</a>).
    This is still in an experimenal stage!</li>
  <li>added an option (-nc) to force the replacement of curves with line segments even for
    backends that support curves.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug with the -flat option not beeing honoured correctly in combination with the
    new -nc option</li>
  <li>added an option to emulate clipping (-sclip). This however results in larger number of
    points ! Use it only if the missing support for clipping causes problems with your file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.12:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>small bug fix in the meta post backend (blank font names) and in the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
  <li>several bug fixes and code reorganization in the subpath simulation part.</li>
  <li>sub path simulation is now available for all backends, not just xfig. However, this was
    not tested very intensively so far. It works quite well with xfig and tgif.</li>
  <li>bug fix for related to the usage of &quot;-f gs:...&quot;.</li>
  <li>small bug fix in the metapost driver and some additions to the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
  <li>added a setglobal also for the &quot;non -nb&quot; case to pstoedit.pro to cope with
    gs5.82.</li>
  <li>bux fix in documentation (-fontmap instead of -mapfile).</li>
  <li>added some support for easier retrieval of dash patterns from within backends.</li>
  <li>extended the check for &quot;mergable&quot; path to include also eofilled pathes and
    made pathsCanBeMerged virtual so it can be overloaded by a specific backend.</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase. This means that all plugins need to be updated
    (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get an error message.</li>
  <li>bug fix in the EMF driver of the plugins.dll and importps.dll regarding the handling of
    closepath.</li>
  <li>added an option to the xfig backend to set the paper width (-f &quot;xfig:-depth <em>depth
    in inches</em>&quot;)</li>
  <li>added an option to the ps2ai driver (-88) to activate the AI-88 format instead of the
    AI-3 format</li>
  <li>added a fontmap.win in the misc directory as an example for a Windows fontmap file.
    (-fontmap option)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.11:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>improved handling of TrueType fonts under Windows 9x/NT. Pstoedit can now deal with
    TrueType fonts if GhostScript is configured for TrueType support.</li>
  <li>fixed an incompatibility with older version of GhostScript</li>
  <li>fixed a bug that was caused when the GS_LIB variable was set.</li>
  <li>added a new backend for the libplot (GNU plotutils) library () (GNU MetaFiles). This
    allows to use the additional format drivers of the GNU plotting utilities.</li>
  <li>Burkhard Plaum <a href="mailto:(plaum_AT_IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de">(plaum_AT_IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de</a>)
    added support for complex filled paths (paths consisting of an arbitraty sequence of
    moveto, lineto and curveto in combination with fill and eofill) to the xfig backend. In
    future, this will be made available to other backend that don't support such pathes as
    well. In order to activate this feature you need to specify the -ssp (simulate sub paths)
    option.</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase due to the support for complex paths. This means
    that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get
    an error message.</li>
  <li>improved the EMF driver in the importps.dll. I now generates much more compact EMF
    files.</li>
  <li>Added a general option for specifying a file containing a font mapping (document font
    -&gt; font in target format). So far this was just used in the mpost backend but this is
    now available for general usage. See the misc directory in the source distribution for an
    example.</li>
  <li>removed the STL dependency in the mport driver. This driver can now be compiled as well
    without having the STL.</li>
  <li>some internal code reorganization.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the test target of the makefile</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.10:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>replaced the -dNOBIND with -dDELAYBIND (Russell Lang pointed this out). This should
    avoid problems with files that redefine standards PostScript operators with totally
    different semantics, e.g. lt (less than) to mean lineto. If you notice different results
    than before use the -nb option to switch back to the previous style (-dNOBIND) and send an
    example to the author, please.</li>
  <li>changed the version of drvbase due to a new virtual function. This means that all
    plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys).</li>
  <li>added a check for a failure in the constructor of drvWMF.</li>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem for systems that don't support shared libraries and some
    warnings issued by the IRIX C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>added the PIC backend contributed by Egil Kvaleberg (<a
    href="mailto:egil_AT_kvaleberg.no">egil_AT_kvaleberg.no</a>)</li>
  <li>added the backend for the Kontour (now replaced by <a
    href="http://www.koffice.org/artwork/">Karbon</a>) format - contributed by Kai-Uwe Sattler
    <a href="mailto:(kus_AT_iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de">(kus_AT_iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de</a>)</li>
  <li>added some files missing for the compilation under Windows and adapted the makefile.</li>
  <li>changed the way the gsview32.ini file is searched.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now also uses the GS_LIB path from the gsview32.ini file ( GhostscriptInclude
    entry). This was done because in some situations the gswin32.dll could not find its own
    init files.</li>
  <li>activated the (dead) -s option again which allows to specify a scaling factor for the
    output. At the moment it is just active for the idraw backend.</li>
  <li>added a MetaPost backend provided by <a href="mailto:scott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org">Scott
    Pakin</a>.</li>
  <li>changed the source code to be compilable against the ANSI iostream header files. This
    was needed because the metapost backend uses STL and the standard string class and thus
    the ANSI headers are needed.</li>
  <li>In this version the drvbase class was changed. This means that you need to get a new
    version of the plugin.dll if you have a previous version. Otherwise you will get an error
    message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.03:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>better handling of &quot;extreme&quot; dash patterns. If the ratio on/off is &gt; 100
    then the line is treated as solid now.</li>
  <li>source code available now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.02:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>new driver for the AI (Adobe Illustrator) format. This is not a real native pstoedit
    driver but instead just a conversion to the AI format using the ps2ai.ps that comes with
    every installation of GhostScript. It is included to provide the same
    &quot;look-and-feel&quot; for the conversion to AI. The additional benefit is that this
    conversion is now available also via the &quot;convert-to-vector&quot; menu of Gsview.
    However, lot's of files don't convert nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native
    pstoedit driver would be much better. Anyone out there to take this ? The AI format is
    usable for example by Mayura Draw (<a href="http://www.mayura.com">http://www.mayura.com</a>
    ). Also a driver to the Mayura native format would be nice.<br>
    However, this new driver relies on a slightly modified ps2ai.ps which hopefully will go
    into the next version of GhostScript.</li>
  <li>Added the handling of GhostScript output in the case the pstoedit.dll is used by gsview.
    Now also messages from GhostScript can be seen in the Gsview message box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.01:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Added a work-around for files redefining &quot;length&quot;</li>
  <li>extended the trouble-shooting section in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.00:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminated compatibility problem with GhostScript 5.xx</li>
  <li>packed most stuff into a pstoedit.dll under windows. This dll can now be called by
    gsview. pstoedit.exe is just a small program calling the pstoedit.dll</li>
  <li>additional drivers can now be put into separate plugin-libraries. See <a
    href="pstoedit.htm">the manual</a> for availability of such drivers.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now calls GhostScript via the DLL interface under Windows. Thanks to Russell
    Lang for his help regarding this.</li>
  <li>new HPGL driver contributed by Peter Katzmann (<a
    href="mailto:p.katzmann_AT_thiesen.com">p.katzmann_AT_thiesen.com</a>)</li>
  <li>fix of a bug in pstoedit.ph which caused an infinite loop.</li>
  <li>some changes in pstoedit.ph to cope with changes in newer version of ghostscript.</li>
  <li>fix of s small bug in drvidraw by Jorge A. Gautier (<a

  <li>new backend for Tcl/Tk contributed by Chris Cox (<a href="mailto:ccox_AT_airmail.net">ccox_AT_airmail.net</a>)</li>
  <li>new internal architecture which now allows link time and run-time loading of backends.</li>
  <li>temporarily dropped support for the OS/2 MET backend (the author was not able to adapt
    the backend to the new architecture so far),</li>
  <li>rewrite of the WMF backend by Thorsten Behrens (<a
    href="mailto:Thorsten_Behrens_AT_public.uni-hamburg.de">Thorsten_Behrens_AT_public.uni-hamburg.de</a>)
    and Bjoern Petersen. The first version of this driver relied on Borland 5.0 and thus was
    not portable to other compilers. Now it uses the pure Windows API and thus compiles also
    with Visual C++</li>
  <li>added a new &quot;gs&quot; pseudo backend which runs GhostScript with a given
    GhostScript output device, e.g. -f gs:pdfwrite runs the GhostScript PDF writer.</li>
  <li>added a -v (for verbose) option</li>
  <li>added a -split option to split the output into individual files for each page</li>
  <li>Bug fix: a default font specified using -df was not used in the xfig backend</li>
  <li>workarounds for two bugs on djgpp (binary open and tempnam)</li>
  <li>-f ps supports emission of curvetos (proposal and partial patch from<br>
    Erik Lundh (<a href="mailto:Erik.Lundh_AT_compelcon.se">Erik.Lundh_AT_compelcon.se</a>))</li>
  <li>PostScript output now generates some DSC comments. At least GhostView understands the
    output.</li>
  <li>xfig output is compatible with new format of xfig 3.2</li>
  <li>xfig output now creates x-splines</li>
  <li>image support for xfig done by Leszek Piotrowicz (<a
    href="mailto:leszek_AT_sopot.rodan.pl">leszek_AT_sopot.rodan.pl</a>)</li>
  <li>image support for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
  <li>added support for dashes for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
  <li>fixed a problem with detection of not available files (MSVC only)</li>
  <li>Changed some code in drvbase.h in order to work around a not implemented feature of the
    HP-CC compiler.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem that causes Turbo C++ to hang (compiler problem)</li>
  <li>changed usage of deviceinfo to currentpagedevice for better compatibility with newer
    version of GhostScript (thanks to Peter L. Deutsch for the hint).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug caused by explicit HWResolution settings from with .ps file (font sizes were
    wrong)<br>
