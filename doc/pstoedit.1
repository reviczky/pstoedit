.SS FROM GSVIEW
.PP
Pstoedit can be called from within gsview via 
"\fBEdit | Convert to vector format\fP"
.PP
.SS FROM PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE ALDUS GRAPHIC IMPORT FILTER INTERFACE
.PP
pstoedit
can also be used as PostScript and PDF graphic import filter for several programs including 
MS\-Office, PaintShop\-Pro and PhotoLine. See 
\fBhttp://www.pstoedit.net/importps/\fP
for more 
details. 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.SS RELEASE LEVEL
.PP
This manpage documents release 3.50 of pstoedit\&.
.PP
.SS USE
.PP
pstoedit
converts PostScript and PDF files to various vector graphic 
formats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various drawing 
packages. Type 
.PP
\fBpstoedit \-help\fP
.PP
to get a list of supported output formats. Pstoedit comes with a 
large set of format drivers integrated in the binary. Additional drivers can be 
installed as plugins and are available via 
\fBhttp://www.pstoedit.net/plugins/\fP\&.
Just copy the plugins to the same directory where the pstoedit binary is installed or \- under Unix like systems only \- alternatively into the lib directory parallel to the bin directory where pstoedit is installed. 
.PP
However, unless you also get a license key for the plugins, the additional 
drivers will slightly distort the resulting graphics. See the documentation 
provided with the plugins for further details. 
.PP
.SS PRINCIPLE OF CONVERSION
.PP
pstoedit
works by redefining the some basic painting operators of 
PostScript, e.g. \fBstroke\fP
or \fBshow\fP
(bitmaps drawn by the image 
operator are not supported by all output formats.) After 
redefining these operators, the PostScript or PDF file that needs to be 
converted is processed by a PostScript interpreter, e.g., Ghostscript 
(\fIgs\fP(1)).
You normally need to have a PostScript interpreter installed in 
order to use this program. However, you can perform some "back end only" processing 
of files following the conventions of the pstoedit intermediate formate by specifying the \fB\-bo\fP
option. See "Available formats and their specific options" below. 
.PP
The output that is written by the interpreter due to the redefinition of the 
drawing operators is a sort of \&'flat\&' PostScript file that contains only simple 
operations like moveto, lineto, show, etc. You can look at this file using the 
\fB\-f debug\fP
option. 
.PP
This output is read by end\-processing functions of pstoedit
and triggers 
the drawing functions in the selected output format driver sometime called also "backend". 
.PP
.SS NOTES
.PP
If you want to process PDF files directly, your PostScript interpreter must 
provide this feature, as does Ghostscript. Aladdin Ghostscript is 
recommended for processing PDF and PostScript files. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.SS GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP
[\fB\-include\fP\fI name of a PostScript file to be included\fP]
 This options allows to specify an additional PostScript file that will be executed just before the normal input is read. This is helpful for including specific page settings or for disabling potentially unsafe PostScript operators, e.g., file, renamefile, or deletefile. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-xscale\fP\fI number\fP]
 scale by a factor in x\-direction 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-yscale\fP\fI number\fP]
 scale by a factor in y\-direction 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-xshift\fP\fI number\fP]
 shift image in x\-direction 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-yshift\fP\fI number\fP]
 shift image in y\-direction 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-centered\fP]
 center image before scaling or shifting 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-split\fP]
 Create a new file for each page of the input. For this the output filename must contain a %d which is replaced with the current page number. This option is automatically switched on for output formats that don\&'t support multiple pages within one file, e.g. fig or gnuplot. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-usebbfrominput\fP]
 If specified, pstoedit uses the BoundingBox as is (hopefully) found in the input file instead of one that is calculated by its own. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-page\fP\fI page number\fP]
 Select a single page from a multi page PostScript or PDF file. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-rgb\fP]
 Since version 3.30 pstoedit uses the CMYK colors internally. The \-rgb option turns on the old behavior to use RGB values. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-useagl\fP]
 use Adobe Glyph List instead of the IsoLatin1 table (this is experimental) 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-noclip\fP]
 don\&'t use clipping (relevant only if output format supports clipping at all) 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-rotate\fP\fI angle (0\-360)\fP]
 Rotage image by angle. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-pagesize\fP\fI page format\fP]
 set page size for output medium. 
This option sets the page size for the output medium. Currently this is just used by the libplot output format driver, but might be used by other output format drivers in future. The page size is specified in terms of the usual page size names, e.g. letter or a4. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-help\fP]
 show the help information 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-gs\fP\fI path to the ghostscript executable/DLL \fP]
 tells pstoedit which ghostscript executable/DLL to use \- overwrites the internal search heuristic 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-bo\fP]
 You can run backend processing only (without the PostScript interpreter frontend) by first running \fBpstoedit\fP
\fB\-f dump\fP
\fIinfile\fP
\fIdumpfile\fP
and then running \fBpstoedit\fP
\fB\-f\fP\fI format\fP
\fB\-bo\fP
\fIdumpfile\fP
\fIoutfile\fP\&.
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-psarg\fP\fI argument string\fP]
 The string given with this option is passed directly to Ghostscript when Ghostscript is called to process the PostScript file for pstoedit\&.
For example: \fB\-psarg\fP\fB "\fP\fB\-r300x300\fP\fB"\fP\&.
This causes the resolution to be changed to 300x300 dpi. (With older versions of GhostScript, changing the resolution this way has an effect only if the \fB\-dis\fP
option is given.) You can switch Ghostscript into PostScript Level 1 only mode by \fB\-psarg "level1.ps"\fP\&.
This can be useful for example if the PostScript file to be converted uses some Level 2 specific custom color models that are not supported by pstoedit. However, this requires that the PostScript program checks for the PostScript level supported by the interpreter and "acts" accordingly. If you want to pass multiple options to Ghostscript you can use multiple \-psarg options \fB\-psarg opt1\fP
\fB\-psarg opt2\fP
\fB\-psarg opt2\fP\&.
See the GhostScript manual for other possible options. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-f\fP\fI "format[:options]"\fP
 target output format recognized by pstoedit\&.
Since other format drivers can be loaded dynamically, type pstoedit \-help
to get a full list of formats. See "Available formats and their specific options " below for an explanation of the [\fI:options\fP]
to \fB\-f\fP
format. If the format option is not given, pstoedit tries to guess the target format from the suffix of the output filename. However, in a lot of cases, this is not a unique mapping and hence pstoedit demands the \fB\-f\fP
option. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-gsregbase\fP\fI GhostScript base registry path\fP]
 registry path to use as a base path when searching GhostScript interpreter 
This option provides means to specify a registry key under HKLM/Software where to search for GS interpreter key, version and GS_DLL / GS_LIB values. Example: "\-gsregbase MyCompany" means that HKLM/Software/MyCompany/GPL GhostScript would be searched instead of HKLM/Software/GPL GhostScript. 
.PP
.SS TEXT AND FONT HANDLING RELATED OPTIONS
.TP
[\fB\-df\fP\fI font name\fP]
 Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript program do not have a fontname. For example, this happens in PostScript files generated by \fIdvips\fP(1)\&.
In such a case pstoedit
uses a replacement font. The default for this is Courier. Another font can be specified using the \fB\-df\fP
option. \fB\-df Helvetica\fP
causes all unnamed fonts to be replaced by Helvetica. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-nomaptoisolatin1\fP]
 Normally pstoedit
maps all character codes to the ones defined by the ISO\-Latin1 encoding. If you specify \fB\-nomaptoisolatin1\fP
then the encoding from the input PostScript is passed unchanged to the output. This may result in strange text output but on the other hand may be the only way to get some fonts converted appropriately. Try what fits best to your concrete case. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-dt\fP]
 Draw text \- Text is drawn as polygons. This might produce a large output file. This option is automatically switched on if the selected output format does not support text, e.g. \fIgnuplot\fP(1)\&.
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-adt\fP]
 Automatic Draw text \- This option turns on the \fB\-dt\fP
option selectively for fonts that seem to be no normal text fonts, e.g. Symbol.. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-ndt\fP]
 Never Draw text \- fully disable the heuristics used by pstoedit to decide when to "draw" text instead of showing it as text. This may produce incorrect results, but in some cases it might nevertheless be useful. "Use at own risk". 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-correctdefinefont\fP]
 Some PostScript files, e.g. such as generated by ChemDraw, use the PostScript definefont operator in way that is incompatible with pstoedit\&'s assumptions. The new font is defined by copying an old font without changing the FontName of the new font. When this option is applied, some "patches" are done after a definefont in order to make it again compatible with pstoedit\&'s assumptions. This option is not enabled per default, since it may break other PostScript file. It is tested only with ChemDraw generated files. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-pti\fP]
 Precision text \- Normally a text string is drawn as it occurs in the input file. However, in some situations, this might produce wrongly positioned characters. This is due to limitiations in most output formats of pstoedit. They cannot represent text with arbitray inter\-letter spacing which is easily possible in PDF and PostScript. With \fB\-pta\fP,
each character of a text string is placed separately. With \fB\-pti\fP,
this is done only in cases when there is a non zero inter\-letter spacing. The downside of "precision text" is a bigger file size and hard to edit text. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-pta\fP]
 see \-pti 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-uchar\fP\fI character\fP]
 Sometimes pstoedit cannot map a character from the encoding used by the PostScript file to the font encoding of the target format. In this case pstoedit replaces the input character by a special character in order to show all the places that couldn\&'t be mapped correctly. The default for this is a "#". Using the \fB\-uchar\fP
option it is possible to specify another character to be used instead. If you want to use a space, use \-uchar " ". 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-t2fontsast1\fP]
 Handle type 2 fonts same as type 1. Type 2 fonts sometimes occur as embedded fonts within PDF files. In the default mode, text using such fonts is drawn as polygons since pstoedit assumes that such a font is not available on the users machine. If this option is set, pstoedit assumes that the internal encoding follows the same as for a standard font and generates normal text output. This assumption may not be true in all cases. But it is nearly impossible for pstoedit to verify this assumption \- it would have to do a sort of OCR. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-nfr\fP]
 In normal mode pstoedit replaces bitmap fonts with a font as defined by the \fB\-df\fP
option. This is done, because most output formats can\&'t handle such fonts. This behavior can be switched off using the \fB\-nfr\fP
option but then it strongly depends on the application reading the the generated file whether the file is usable and correctly interpreted or not. Any problems are then out of control of pstoedit. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-glyphs\fP]
 pass glyph names to the output format driver. So far no output format driver really uses the glyph names, so this does not have any effect at the moment. It is a preparation for future work. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-useoldnormalization\fP]
 Just use this option in case the new heuristic introduced in 3.5 doesn\&'t produce correct results \- however, this normalization of font encoding will always be a best\-effort approach since there is no real general solution to it with reasonable effort 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-fontmap\fP\fI name of font map file for pstoedit\fP]
 The font map is a simple text file containing lines in the following format:
.br 
.PP
document_font_name target_font_name 
.br 
Lines beginning with % are considerd comments 
.br 
If a font name contains spaces, use the "font name with spaces" notation. 
.PP
Each font name found in the document is checked against this mapping and if there is a corresponding entry, the new name is used for the output. 
.PP
If the \fB\-fontmap\fP
option is not specified, pstoedit
automatically looks for the file \fIdrivername\fP\&.fmp
in the installation directory and uses that file as a default fontmap file if available. The installation directory is: 
.PP
.RS

.TP

.PP
The mpost.fmp in the misc directory of the pstoedit distibution is a sample map file with mappings from over 5000 PostScript font names to their TeXequivalents. This is useful because MetaPost is frequently used with TeX/LaTeX and those programs don\&'t use standard font names. This file and the MetaPost output format driver are provided by Scott Pakin (\fBscott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org\fP).
Another example is wemf.fmp to be used under Windows. See the misc directory of the pstoedit source distribution. 
.PP
.RE
.PP
.SS DEBUG OPTIONS
.RE
.TP
[\fB\-dis\fP]
 Open a display during processing by Ghostscript. Some files only work correctly this way. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-q\fP]
 quiet mode \- do not write startup message 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-nq\fP]
 No exit from the PostScript interpreter. Normally Ghostscript exits after processing the pstoedit input\-file. For debugging it can be useful to avoid this. If you do, you will have to type quit at the GS> prompt to exit from Ghostscript. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-v\fP]
 Switch on verbose mode. Some additional information is shown during processing. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-nb\fP]
 Since version 3.10 pstoedit
uses the \-dDELAYBIND
option when calling GhostScript. Previously the \-dNOBIND
option was used instead but that sometimes caused problems if a user\&'s PostScript file overloaded standard PostScript operator with totally new semantic, e.g. lt for lineto instead of the standard meaning of "less than". Using \fB\-nb\fP
the old style can be activated again in case the \-dDELAYBIND
gives different results as before. In such a case please also contact the author. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-ups\fP]
 write text as plain string instead of hex string in intermediate format \- normally useful for trouble shooting and debugging only. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-keep\fP]
 keep the intermediate files produced by pstoedit \- for debug purposes only 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-gstest\fP]
 perform a basic test for the interworking with GhostScript 
.PP
.SS DRAWING RELATED OPTIONS
.TP
[\fB\-nc\fP]
 no curves. 
Normally pstoedit tries to keep curves from the input and transfers them to the output if the output format supports curves. If the output format does not support curves, then pstoedit replaces curves by a series of lines (see also \fB\-flat\fP
option). However, in some cases the user might wish to have this behavior also for output formats that originally support curves. This can be forced via the \fB\-nc\fP
option. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-nsp\fP]
 normally subpathes are used if the output format support them. This option turns off subpathes. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-mergelines\fP]
 Some output formats permit the representation of filled polygons with edges that are in a different color than the fill color. Since PostScript does not support this by the standard drawing primitives directly, drawing programs typically generate two objects (the outline and the filled polygon) into the PostScript output. pstoedit
is able to recombine these, if they follow each other directly and you specify \fB\-mergelines\fP\&.
However, this merging is not supported by all output formats due to restrictions in the target format. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-filledrecttostroke\fP]
 Rectangles filled with a solid color can be converted to a stroked line with a width that corresponds to the width of the rectangle. This is of primary interest for output formats which do not support filled polygons at all. But it is restricted to rectangles only, i.e. it is not supported for general polygons 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-mergetext\fP]
 In order to produce nice looking text output, programs producing PostScript files often split words into smaller pieces which are then placed individually on adjacent positions. However, such split text is hard to edit later on and hence it is sometime better to recombine these pieces again to form a word (or even sequence of words). For this pstoedit implements some heuristics about what text pieces are to be considered parts of a split word. This is based on the geometrical proximity of the different parts and seems to work quite well so far. But there are certainly cases where this simple heuristic fails. So please check the results carefully. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-ssp\fP]
 simulate sub paths. 
Several output formats don\&'t support PostScript pathes containing sub pathes, i.e. pathes with intermediate movetos. In the normal case, each subpath is treated as an independent path for such output formats. This can lead to bad looking results. The most common case where this happens is if you use the \fB\-dt\fP
option and show some text with letters like e, o, or b, i.e. letter that have a "hole". When the \fB\-ssp\fP
option is set, pstoedit tries to eliminate these problems. However, this option is CPU time intensive! 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-flat\fP\fI flatness factor\fP]
 If the output format does not support curves in the way PostScript does or if the \fB\-nc\fP
option is specified, all curves are approximated by lines. Using the \fB\-flat\fP
option one can control this approximation. This parameter is directly converted to a PostScript \fBsetflat\fP
command. Higher numbers, e.g. 10 give rougher, lower numbers, e.g. 0.1 finer approximations. 
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-sclip\fP]
 simulate clipping. 
Most output formats of pstoedit don\&'t have native support for clipping. For that pstoedit
offers an option to perform the clipping of the graphics directly without passing the clippath to the output driver. However, this results in curves being replaced by a lot of line segments and thus larger output files. So use this option only if your output looks different from the input due to clipping. In addition, this "simulated clipping" is not exactly the same as defined in PostScript. There might be lines drawn at the double size. Also clipping of text is not supported unless you also use the \fB\-dt\fP
option. 
.PP
.SS INPUT AND OUTFILE FILE ARGUMENTS
[ inputfile [outputfile] ] 
.PP
If neither an input nor an output file is given as argument, pstoedit works as filter reading from standard input and 
writing to standard output. 
The special filename "\-" can also be used. It represents standard input if it is the first on the command line and standard output if it is the second. So "pstoedit \- output.xxx" reads from standard input and writes to output.xxx 
.PP
.SH AVAILABLE FORMATS AND THEIR SPECIFIC OPTIONS

.PP
pstoedit
allows passing individual options to a output format driver. This is done by 
appending all options to the format specified after the \fB\-f\fP
option. The format 
specifier and its options must be separated by a colon (:). If more than one 
option needs to be passed to the output format driver, the whole argument to \fB\-f\fP
must be 
enclosed within double\-quote characters, thus: 
.PP
\fB\-f\fP\fI "format[:option option ...]"\fP
.PP
To see which options are supported by a specific format, type: 
\fBpstoedit \-f format:\-help\fP

 Newer versions of Windows (2000, XP, Vista) will not accept WMF/EMF files generated when this option is set and the input contains Text. But if this option is not set, then the WMF/EMF driver will estimate interletter spacing of text using a very coarse heuristic. This may result in ugly looking output. On the other hand, OpenOffice can still read EMF/WMF files where pstoedit delegates the calculation of the inter letter spacing to the program reading the WMF/EMF file. So if the generated WMF/EMF file shall never be processed under Windows, use this option. If WMF/EMF files with high precision text need to be generated under *nix the only option is to use the \-pta option of pstoedit. However that causes every text to be split into single characters which makes the text hard to edit afterwards. Hence the \-nfw options provides a sort of compromise between portability and nice to edit but still nice looking text. Again \- this option has no meaning when pstoedit is executed under Windows anyway. In that case the output is portable but nevertheless not split and still looks fine.

.SH NOTES

.PP
.SS AUTOTRACE
.PP
pstoedit cooperates with autotrace. Autotrace can now produce a dump file 
for further processing by pstoedit using the \fB\-bo\fP
(backend only) option. 
Autotrace is a program written by a group around Martin Weber and can be 
found at \fBhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/\fP\&.
.PP
.SS PS2AI
.PP
The ps2ai output format driver is not a native pstoedit output format driver. It does not use the 
pstoedit postcript flattener, instead it uses the PostScript program 
ps2ai.ps which is installed in the GhostScript distribution directory. It 
is included to provide the same "look\-and\-feel" for the conversion to AI. 
The additional benefit is that this conversion is now available also via 
the "convert\-to\-vector" menu of Gsview. However, lot\&'s of files don\&'t 
convert nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native pstoedit driver would 
be much better. Anyone out there to take this? The AI format is usable for 
example by Mayura Draw (\fBhttp://www.mayura.com\fP).
Also a driver to the 
Mayura native format would be nice. 
.PP
An alternative to the ps2ai based driver is available via the \-f plot:ai format if the libplot(ter) is installed. 
.PP
You should use a version of GhostScript greater than or equal to 6.00 for using the ps2ai output format driver. 
.PP
.SS METAPOST
.PP
Note that, as far as Scott knows, MetaPost does not support PostScript\&'s 
eofill. The metapost output format driver just converts eofill to fill, and issues a warning if 
verbose is set. Fortunately, very few PostScript programs rely on the 
even\-odd fill rule, even though many specify it. 
.PP
For more on MetaPost see: 
.PP
\fBhttp://cm.bell\-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html\fP
.PP
.SS LATEX2E
.PP
.TP
.B *
LaTeX2e\&'s picture environment is not very powerful. As a result, many 
elementary PostScript constructs are ignored \-\- fills, line 
thicknesses (besides "thick" and "thin"), and dash patterns, to name a 
few. Furthermore, complex pictures may overrun TeX\&'s memory capacity. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
Some PostScript constructs are not supported directly by "picture", 
but can be handled by external packages. If a figure uses color, the 
top\-level document will need to do a "\\usepackage{color}"\&. And if a 
figure contains rotated text, the top\-level document will need to do a 
"\\usepackage{rotating}"\&. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
All lengths, coordinates, and font sizes output by the output format driver are in 
terms of \\unitlength, so scaling a figure is simply a matter of doing 
a "\\setlength{\\unitlength}{...}"\&. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
The output format driver currently supports one output format driver specific option, 
"integers", which rounds all lengths, coordinates, and font sizes to 
the nearest integer. This makes hand\-editing the picture a little 
nicer. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
Why is this output format driver useful? One answer is portability; any LaTeX2e 
system can handle the picture environment, even if it can\&'t handle 
PostScript graphics. (pdfLaTeX comes to mind here.) A second answer 
is that pictures can be edited easily to contain any arbitrary LaTeX2e 
code. For instance, the text in a figure can be modified to contain 
complex mathematics, non\-Latin alphabets, bibliographic citations, or 
\-\- the real reason Scott wrote the LaTeX2e output format driver \-\- hyperlinks to the 
surrounding document (with help from the hyperref package). 
.PP
.SS CREATING A NEW OUTPUT FORMAT DRIVER
.PP
To implement a new output format driver you can start from drvsampl.cpp
and 
drvsampl.h\&.
See also comments in drvbase.h
and 
drvfuncs.h
for an explanation of methods that should be implemented 
for a new output format driver. 
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.PP
A default PostScript interpreter to be called by pstoedit is specified at 
compile time. You can overwrite the default by setting the GS environment 
variable to the name of a suitable PostScript interpreter. 
.PP
You can check which name of a PostScript interpreter was compiled into 
pstoedit using: \fBpstoedit\fP
\fB\-help \-v\fP\&.
.PP
See the GhostScript manual for descriptions of environment variables used by 
Ghostscript most importantly GS_FONTPATH and GS_LIB; other 
environment variables also affect output to display, print, and additional 
filtering and processing. See the related documentation. 
.PP
pstoedit
allocates temporary files using the function \fItempnam\fP(3)\&.
Thus the location for temporary files might be controllable by other 
environment variables used by this function. See the \fItempnam\fP(3)
manpage 
for descriptions of environment variables used. On UNIX like system this is 
probably the TMPDIR variable, on DOS/WINDOWS either TMP or 
TEMP\&. 
.PP
.SH TROUBLE SHOOTING

.PP
If you have problems with pstoedit
first try whether Ghostscript 
successfully displays your file. If yes, then try 
\fBpstoedit\fP
\fB\-f ps\fP
\fIinfile.ps\fP
\fItestfile.ps\fP
and check whether \fItestfile.ps\fP
still displays correctly using 
Ghostscript. If this file doesn\&'t look correctly then there seems to be a 
problem with pstoedit\&'s
PostScript frontend. If this file looks good 
but the output for a specific format is wrong, the problem is probably in 
the output format driver for the specific format. In either case send bug fixes and 
reports to the author. 
.PP
A common problem with PostScript files is that the PostScript file redefines 
one of the standard PostScript operators inconsistently. There is no effect 
of this if you just print the file since the original PostScript "program" 
uses these new operator in the new meaning and does not use the original 
ones anymoew. However, when run under the control of pstoedit, these 
operators are expected to work with the original semantics. 
.PP
So far I\&'ve seen redefinitions for: 
.PP
.TP
.B *
lt \- "less\-then" to mean "draw a line to" 
.TP
.B *
string \- "create a string object" to mean "draw a string" 
.TP
.B *
length \- "get the length of e.g. a string" to a "float constant" 
.PP
I\&'ve included work\-arounds for the ones mentioned above, but some others 
could show up in addition to those. 
.PP
.SH RESTRICTIONS

.PP
.TP
.B *
Non\-standard fonts (e.g. TeXbitmap fonts) are mapped to a default font which 
can be changed using the \fB\-df\fP
option. pstoedit
chooses the size of 
the replacement font such that the width of the string in the original font is 
the same as in the replacement font. This is done for each text fragment 
displayed. Special character encoding support is limited in this case. If a 
character cannot be mapped into the target format, pstoedit displays a \&'#\&' 
instead. See also the \-uchar option. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
pstoedit supports bitmap graphics only for some output format drivers. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
Some output format drivers, e.g. the Gnuplot output format driver or the 3D output format driver (rpl, lwo, rib) do not support text. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
For most output format drivers pstoedit does not support clipping (mainly due to limitations in the target format). You can try to use the 
\fB\-sclip\fP
option to simulate clipping. However, this doesn\&'t work in all cases 
as expected. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
Special note about the Java output format drivers (java1 and java2). 
The java output format drivers generate a java source file that needs other files in 
order to be compiled and usable. These other files are Java classes (one 
applet and support classes) that allow to step through the individual pages 
of a converted PostScript document. This applet can easily be activated from 
a html\-document. See the contrib/java/java1/readme_java1.txt
or 
contrib/java/java2/readme_java2.htm
file for more details. 
.PP
.SH FAQS

.PP
.TP
1.
Why do letters like O or B get strange if converted to tgif/xfig 
using the \fB\-dt\fP
option? 
.PP
This is because most output format drivers don\&'t support composite paths with 
intermediate gaps (moveto\&'s) and second don\&'t support very well the (eo)fill 
operators of PostScript (winding rule). For such objects pstoedit
breaks 
them into smaller objects whenever such a gap is found. This results in the 
"hole" beeing filled with black color instead of beeing transparent. Since 
version 3.11 you can try the \fB\-ssp\fP
option in combination with the xfig 
output format driver. 
.PP
.TP
2.
Why does pstoedit produce ugly results from PostScript files generated 
by dvips? 
.PP
TeX documents usually use bitmap fonts. Such fonts cannot be used as native 
font in other format. So pstoedit replaces the TeX font with another native 
font. Of course, the replacement font will in most cases produce another 
look, especially if mathematical symbols are used. 
Try to use PostScript fonts instead of the bitmap fonts when generating a PostScript file from TeX or LaTeX.
