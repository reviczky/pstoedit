% M. C. Escher style impossible triangle
% written by Guy Shaw

% Things that are easy to play with:
% Position on paper, overall size, and linewidth
/inch { 72 mul } bind def

2 inch dup translate
3 inch dup scale
1 3 inch div setlinewidth

% Thickness parameter:
% /Thick is the thickness of the structural members of the triange,
% as a fraction of the height of the triangle.
% Reasonable looking impossible triangles can be obtained with Thick <= 1/6.
% right at /Thick == 1/6, there is no space left inside the triangle.
% /Thick > 1/6 yields bizarre, but not very interesting results.
% /Thick < 1/20 is less interesting, because the "impossibility"
% is not so striking when the structural members are that thin.
% A good "standard" value is 1/8.

/Thick 1 8 div def

% You would not normally want to change anything that follows.
